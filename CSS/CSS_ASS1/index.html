                It is no news that everything around us nowadays is going digital and <b>technology is leading the way in various facets of life</b>. I am primarily an Industrial Chemist who also holds a ph.D. in Polymer Organic Chemistry but i also love the different cool things one can do with technology. Technology just makes life easier in so many ways. The things that would have required hours of manual hard labor can be completed by a computer in less than a second. There are various softwares available in my field that are result of technological advancement and it makes the progression of things very seemless. Of great interest to me is also another part of tech such as Machine learning and artificial intelligence. This aspects makes the processing of very large data sets quick to analyze and gives insight to the information that can greatly be of help to the society. Although there is nothing with great advantage that also does not come with disadvantages, but the tech field has also found a way to deal with those disadvantages, giving rise to another aspect known as cybersecurity; this is a very good way to protect our online persona if well mastered. The field of technology is very wide and new things keep evolving everyday; this excites me as my mind is so curios as to the next new big tech thing we can achieve in the future. <i>The innovations and the thrill of learning new things are the bedrock of my interest in the tech field.</i>

            <h1 class="name">Stutern Journey So Far</h1>
            <p>
                <i>I have learnt a lot so far from stutern</i>, and I have got to solidify them through the peer learning group sections. Starting out with the two weeks group study was really helpful and i got to go through the basics of <b>Git & Github</b>, <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS.</b> <br>
                After the two weeks of group study, we started the live learning sessions where we dived deep into the main parts of our basic studies. We learnt how to create a repository on github and how to push to this repo. Also, we learnt about the other git commands that makes working with git and github easier.<br>
                Next we moved on to <b>HTML</b> and learnt how to markup webpages with different HTML tags and elements. We had assignments and quizzes to help seal our learning and also had a final <i>HTML project</i> to complete the lesson.<br>
            T   his week started learning <b>CSS</b> to style the marked up webpages and design it to taste. <br>
                <b>CSS</b> stands for Cascading Style Sheets and describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.

            <h1 class="name">CSS Box Model</h1>
            <p>
                In CSS, the term <i>"box model"</i> is used when talking about design and layout.<br>
                The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding,and the actual content.<br>
                <b>Content:</b> The content of the box, where text and images appear.<br>
                <b>Padding:</b> Padding is used to create space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.
                Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent.<br>
                <b>Border:</b> A border that goes around the padding and content. The border properties allow us to specify the style, width, and color of an element's border.<br>
                <b>Margin:</b> Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent. Margins are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.
